  "description": "In Uzbekistan(my home country), especially in Tashkent(the capital city), new businesses such as cafes, restaurants, shops, educational centers, gyms are being opened every day. Such new businesses or existing ones resort to expensive ad platforms such as TV or popular e-newspapers or inefficient ones such as flyer distribution to advertise their openings or new deals/discounts. In the opposite side, people are constantly looking for such deals to save money or enjoy an activity with their friends, but are frustrated as their is no go-to platform that can be used to browse through the deals.",
